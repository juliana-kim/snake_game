- Pressing any arrow key(up/down/left/right) starts the snake moving in that direction.

- When the snake eats an apple, it's body length increases, and the apple appears at a random position on the game screen.

- When the snake goes off-screen, it reappears on the opposite side.

- If the snake collides with its own body, the game ends and resets its state.
